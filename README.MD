# VBA-Challenge

## Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:


- The ticker symbol.

- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock. 

- Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

- Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

- Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
